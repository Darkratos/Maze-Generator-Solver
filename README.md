# Maze-Generator-Solver
p5.js implementation of maze generation with backtracking + solving with A*

In the sample images, there are two examples of the final result, in a 500x500 grid.  
The first took about 36 seconds to finish, and the second took about 3 minutes.  
The time is related to the complexity of the maze.
